# DnD Within
Welcome to my first ever solo coding project!

Have you ever thought, how could I make DMing a game of Dungeons and Dragons even more nerdy?

No? 

Well here you go anyway. 

DnD Within allows you to setup mock encounters similar to KFC+ but within the command line!

Not only will your friends at work think that you're a nerd for playing DnD, but your DnD party will think your a nerd for loading up your terminal in the middle of a session!
